                <p>“Vigorously reported, superbly organized...for those of us who didn't pursue MBAs and have the penny-ante salaries to prove it.”</p>
                <h5>Julia Keller, Chicago Tribune</h5>
                <p>“Sorkin's prodigious reporting and lively writing put the reader in the room for some of the biggest-dollar conference calls in history. It's an entertaining, brisk book.”</p>
